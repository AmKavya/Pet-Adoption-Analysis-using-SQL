# 🐾 Driving Adoption Success Through Data  

## 📌 Overview  
This project analyzes adoption data from animal shelters to uncover patterns, challenges, and opportunities for improvement. By using SQL queries and data-driven insights, it highlights adoption trends, shelter occupancy, adopter behavior, and return risks.  

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Increase adoption rates by identifying key drivers.  
- Optimize shelter operations through occupancy analysis.  
- Understand adopter demographics and motivations.  
- Reduce adoption returns by studying root causes.  
- Use predictive insights to forecast shelter strain and adoption demand.  

## 📊 Key Insights  
- Out of 1,114 animals, only **19% were adopted** while **680+ remain in shelters**.  
- Shelters in **Chennai & Delhi face 70–75% occupancy**, while others are underutilized.  
- Dogs and cats wait an average of **2+ years** for adoption.  
- **47% of returns** are due to behavior issues, showing a need for adopter support.  
- **30% of successful adoptions** already happen through fostering, proving its impact.  

## 🚀 Strategic Roadmap  
- Engage younger adopters through digital-first campaigns.  
- Scale foster programs to ease shelter strain.  
- Address breed bias with “Adopt a Desi” awareness drives.  
- Use predictive analytics to balance shelter capacity.  
- Provide behavioral training and transparent health disclosures.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **SQL** (joins, grouping, window functions, date functions)  
- **Database Design** (ERD with shelters, adopters, animals, adoptions, cities)  

## ✅ Conclusion  
Data doesn’t just describe adoption—it enables action. With the right strategies, shelters can reduce overcrowding, cut waiting times, and give more strays the forever homes they deserve.
